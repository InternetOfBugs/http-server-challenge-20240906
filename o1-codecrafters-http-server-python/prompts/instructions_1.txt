This code: ```
import socket  # noqa: F401


def main():
    # You can use print statements as follows for debugging, they'll be visible when running tests.
    print("Logs from your program will appear here!")

    # Uncomment this to pass the first stage
    #
    server_socket = socket.create_server(("localhost", 4221), reuse_port=True)
    server_socket.accept() # wait for client


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

is a basic http server.

Please change it so that it  will respond to an HTTP request with a 200 response.

HTTP response

An HTTP response is made up of three parts, each separated by a CRLF (\r\n):

    Status line.
    Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
    Optional response body.

In this stage, your server's response will only contain a status line. Here's the response your server must send:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n

Here's a breakdown of the response:

// Status line
HTTP/1.1  // HTTP version
200       // Status code
OK        // Optional reason phrase
\r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

// Headers (empty)
\r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Response body (empty)

Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh

The tester will then send an HTTP GET request to your server:

$ curl -v http://localhost:4221

Your server must respond to the request with the following response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n

Notes

    You can ignore the contents of the request. We'll cover parsing requests in later stages.
    For more information about HTTP responses, see the MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses or the HTTP/1.1 specification.
    This challenge uses HTTP/1.1.
